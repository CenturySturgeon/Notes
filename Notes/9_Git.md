## Connecting a new PC to your GitHub profile

1. Generate a token using the instructions from [Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens):
   - GitHub profile -> Settings -> Developer Settings -> Personal access tokens

2. Open your git bash and set up the token using the following commands:

    ```bash
    git config --global credential.https://github.username <your_username>
    git config --global credential.https://github.com.token <your_token>
    ```

**REMEMBER:** Don't forget to set the token's permissions, even for public repositories!

## Removing a file added with `git add`

Just use `git reset <file>` and the file will be removed from the current index (the "about to be committed" list) without changing anything else.

To unstage **all files** from the current stage set use `git reset`
